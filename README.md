# Calendar 📅
## I had already made a project for a clock where it showed the date and time. So he led me to want to evolve the idea and build a calendar now. 🗓️
## the calendar has all the days of the year and whenever you enter it, it will be in the year and on the correct day marked on the calendar. ✔️
## And it was my first project where I applied the dark mode, it was really fun to do with css and javascript 🔥
